Algorithm of Shortest Path
==========================
This is one of my course designs, you can get the shortest path in map of data stucture, like the dijkstra.

Written by Ruby Language.

data.txt Introction
first line is the number of nodes.
second line is the start node.
the others are edge of the map.
first number | second number | third numer
from node      to node         length
